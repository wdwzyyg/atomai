class Segmentor(SegTrainer):

    Model for semantic segmentation-based analysis of images

    Args:
        model:
            Type of model to train: 'Unet', 'ResHedNet' or 'dilnet' (Default: 'Unet').
            See atomai.nets for more details. One can also pass here a custom
            fully convolutional neural network model.
        nb_classes:
            Number of classes in classification scheme (last NN layer)
        **batch_norm (bool):
            Apply batch normalization after each convolutional layer
            (Default: True)
        **dropout (bool):
            Apply dropouts to the three inner blocks in the middle of a network
            (Default: False)
        **upsampling_mode (str):
            "bilinear" or "nearest" upsampling method (Default: "bilinear")
        **nb_filters (int):
            Number of convolutional filters (aka "kernels") in the first
            convolutional block (this number doubles in the consequtive block(s),
            see definition of *Unet* and *dilnet* models for details)
        **with_dilation (bool):
            Use dilated convolutions in the bottleneck of *Unet*
            (Default: False)
        **layers (list):
            List with a number of layers in each block.
            For *UNet* the first 4 elements in the list
            are used to determine the number of layers
            in each block of the encoder (including bottleneck layer),
            and the number of layers in the decoder  is chosen accordingly
            (to maintain symmetry between encoder and decoder)

    Example:

    >>> # Initialize model
    >>> model = aoi.models.Segmentor(nb_classes=3)
    >>> # Train
    >>> model.fit(images, masks, images_test, masks_test,
    >>>        training_cycles=300, compute_accuracy=True, swa=True)
    >>> # Predict with trained model
    >>> nn_output, coordinates = model.predict(expdata)

                4D numpy array or pytorch tensor of training images
                (n_samples, 1, height, width). One can also pass a regular
                3D image stack without a channel dimension of 1 which will
                be added automatically
            y_train:
                4D (binary) / 3D (multiclass) numpy array or pytorch tensor
                of training masks (aka ground truth) stacked along
                the first dimension. The reason why in the multiclass case
                the X_train is 4-dimensional and the y_train is 3-dimensional
                is because of how the cross-entropy loss is calculated in PyTorch
                (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#nllloss).
            X_test:
                4D numpy array or pytorch tensor of test images

                loss function. Available loss functions are: 'mse' (MSE),
                'ce' (cross-entropy), 'focal' (focal loss; single class only),
                and 'dice' (dice loss)
            optimizer:
                weights optimizer (defaults to Adam optimizer with lr=1e-3)
            training_cycles: Number of training 'epochs'.
                If full_epoch argument is set to False, 1 epoch == 1 mini-batch.
                Otherwise, each cycle corresponds to all mini-batches of data
                passing through a NN.
            batch_size: Size of training and test mini-batches
            compute_accuracy:
                Computes accuracy function at each training cycle
            full_epoch:
                If True, passes all mini-batches of training/test data
                at each training cycle and computes the average loss. If False,
                passes a single (randomly chosen) mini-batch at each cycle.

                Saves the recent stochastic weights and averages
                them at the end of training
            perturb_weights:
                Time-dependent weight perturbation, :math:`w\\leftarrow w + a / (1 + e)^\\gamma`,
                where parameters *a* and *gamma* can be passed as a dictionary,
                together with parameter *e_p* determining every *n*-th epoch at
                which a perturbation is applied
            **lr_scheduler (list of floats):
                List with learning rates for each training iteration/epoch.
                If the length of list is smaller than the number of training iterations,
                the last values in the list is used for the remaining iterations.

                Prints loss every *n*-th epoch
            **accuracy_metrics (str):
